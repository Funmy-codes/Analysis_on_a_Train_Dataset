# Analysis_on_a_Train_Dataset

A lot of data anlysis tasks was performed on this repository such as importing datasets, checking for null values, separating categorical and numerical data, and conducting group analysis (e.g., average age by education level) demonstrates data inspection, cleaning, exploration, and visualization techniques to uncover insights from the dataset.
The dataset contains both categorical and numerical features related to demographic variables. It was used for general exploration and analysis to identify relationships between variables.


In this repository, we:
-  Load a dataset containing various features.
-  Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
-  Perform descriptive statistics and summary analysis.
-  Visualize important relationships between variables.
-  Group data by certain categories and calculate key metrics (e.g., average age by education level).


Key Steps in the Repository


1. Data Import and Inspection

-    Loaded the dataset and imported the necessary Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly).
-    Inspected the dataset to check for missing values and understood its basic structure using info() and describe().
  
2.  Data Exploration

-    Separated categorical and numerical data for focused analysis.
-    Conducted analysis such as calculating the average age for each education level using group-based operations.

3.  Data Visualization

-    Visualized the distribution of numerical and categorical variables using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
-    Generated plots such as bar charts and histograms to gain deeper insights into the relationships within the data.
